# Vineyard - Product List with Cart

### Built with

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- React Context API
- FontAwesome Icons

## The challenge

The goal of this project was to create a responsive and interactive product listing page with a cart for an online store. The design and functionality were enhanced from the original concept to improve usability and showcase a modern shopping experience.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- Interact with hover states for buttons and icons.
- Add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and see accurate totals in real time.
- Place an order and view a confirmation modal.

## Technical Features

- Routing with Next.js: Navigate between the home page and the product list seamlessly.
- Dynamic Context Management: Cart functionality is implemented using React Context API for state management.
- Reusable Components: Key UI elements like product cards and cart items are modular and maintainable.
- Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS is used to ensure the layout adapts beautifully across devices.
- Modern Patterns: Leverages React best practices, TypeScript for type safety, and FontAwesome for intuitive icons.
